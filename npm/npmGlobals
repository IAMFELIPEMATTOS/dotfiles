# tldr; DO NOT install any of your project's devDependencies as global.
#
# Be aware about npm globals. Keep your devDependencies versioned in your
# project's package.json file, unless you really know what you are doing.

#
# Also, (most) packages here are not devDependencies. Not all npm modules are.
# Just cool stuff, mostly.
#
# NOTE: Don't forget to update your global packages regularly.
